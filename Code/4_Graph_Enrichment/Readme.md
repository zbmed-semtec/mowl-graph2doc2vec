## Objective
Here we are creating new graphs by doing traversals through the MeSH ontology projected graph.

The main strategy from v1 to v4 consists of finding the smallest path between 2 nodes that have an edge 
in the initial graph that represents an abstract, we collect all the unique nodes that appear in all the path traversals and that  basically represents our new graph for an abstract.

The difference between the versions  v1 to v4 basically are performance improvements.
